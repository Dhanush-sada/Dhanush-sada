- ⚡ Fun fact: The term "bug" comes from a literal bug! The term "debugging" to fix software errors originated from a real incident in 1947 when Grace Hopper and her team found a moth trapped in a relay of a computer, causing a malfunction. They taped the bug into their logbook and noted, "First actual case of bug being found."
